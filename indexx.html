      <h2>BIOGRAPHY</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a passionate learner what some might call an opportunist because
        I take advantage of every opportunity that comes my way. I always
        see the good and the positives in every aspect of life and never
        let the negatives weigh me down. I'm transitioning into a career
        in Cloud Engineering with the goal of becoming a Cloud Solutions
        Developer.

        Structure. To keep it simple, I joined Altschool to give my career
        path a clear structure. I see Altschool as the best step toward
        achieving my dream of becoming a Cloud Developer. I've heard
        testimonials about how well-structured their programs are, and how
        excellent the instructors can be. I also hope to build valuable
        career connections here.
